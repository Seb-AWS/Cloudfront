## AWS Useful Stuff
*Or at least I find it useful on occasion...*

### Cloudfront Funtions
- Cloudfront Function Script `add_query_string.js` will leverage Cloudfront in adding a query string to a request received at an Edge Location, this query string is then passed back to the origin having never been added by the requester.
- `CFF-HSTS.js` allows you to add Strict-Transport Security headers to HTTP requests.

### Changelog
